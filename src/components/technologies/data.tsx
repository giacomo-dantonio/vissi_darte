        <p>I started using <b>.Net</b> and <i>C#</i> at Elise.</p>
        <p>Before that I used to think that all programming languages
        are more or less the same. I used to call myself <i>language-agnostic</i>.
        Getting in touch with the <i>.Net</i> world I realized
        that, while most programming languages are almost equivalent,
        the <b>culture</b> and the <b>communities</b> around one technology
        are not.
        </p>
        <p>In the <b>.Net</b> community a lot of emphasis is placed
        on <b>OOP principles</b> and <b>patterns</b>.
        I am talking about things like <b>SOLID</b>, <b>MVVM</b>, and so on.
        The functional programming principles I was used to in the
        JavaScript community are on the other hand not much known
        among .Net developers.
        I learned all that stuff, but I must say I'm still not
        a big fan of idiomatic OOP. I prefer functional programming.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand <b>.Net</b> is the perfect framework for
        business applications. I was able to become proficient in a couple
        of weeks. Unlike C++, it is very difficult to write bad
        code which breaks everything in C#. The framework promotes code
        quality by design. Also <b>.Net</b> has a solution for all
        common use cases you will find in Desktop and Cloud development.
        C# may not be the most beautiful language out there, but it is
        perfect to get things done quickly and safe.
        </p>
        <p>Also I find it great that Microsoft open sourced <b>.Net core</b> and
        that Linux is now a first class citizen for <b>.Net</b>.
        Now Windows developers are able to write Linux server applications,
        how cool is that!

        <p>The <b>Finite Elements Method</b> is the heart of a
        generative engineering system like <i>Elise</i>.
        You use it for topology optimization,
        for <b>Design of Experiments</b> (DoE) and for validating
        your parts.
        At <i>Elise</i> I implemented pre and post-processing for
        FEM simulations.
        </p>

        <p>My mathematics studies focused on algebra and geometry.
        So, I didn't learn FEM at university. However I did read
        a university textbook on the topic after I started at <i>Elise</i>.
        I actually did not implement an FEM solver, but I wanted to know
        how an FEM solver works.

        </p>

        <p>When I came to <i>Elise</i> they already had a pretty decent

        I worked on the Jenkins Pipeline to add code coverage and

        <p>At <i>Contact Software</i> we were using <b>SQL</b> relational

        <p>
        I wrote quite some complex recursive queries to retrieve data.
        I also optimized them for performance.
        I used <b>Oracle</b> and <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> database

function javascript() {

        <p>I learned <b>HTML</b> in the late 90's as a teenager
        (using Netscape and Opera),
        but I started writing serious <b>JavaScript</b> code
        at <i>Contact Software</i>.
        We were pioneers. We started writing web applications with ES5.
        React did not exist yet.
        </p>
        <p>Across the years we experimented with many frameworks,
        did some work áºƒith <i>Ember.js</i>, until we decided to use <b>React</b>.
        After that I wrote a lot of <b>React</b> code.
        We were using <b>Redux</b> and <b>Redux Saga</b> for state management
        and <b>Sass</b> for styling.
        </p>
        <p>Today is <b>JavaScript</b> one of my favorite languages.
        When I need a UI for my personal projects, I always use
        JavaScript and React. For the business logic I like to
        use <b>WebAssembly</b> whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>The only issue I had with JavaScript is the lack of
        static analysis, which often lead to bugs in my code.
        Recently I started using <b>TypeScript</b> for that, and that
        fixed the problem completely.
        </p>
        <p>So now <b>TypeScript</b> + <b>React/Redux</b> +
        <b>Rust/Webassembly</b> is my favorite stack.

            which I developed from the beginning.
            After a while more developers joined the team.</p>

            <p>The purpose of the <b>3D Visualization</b> module was
            to visualize CAD data which could be reassembled according
            to the BOM and variants defined in the system.
            Several different use cases needed to be supported. Such
            as measuraments, annotations, collaboration and navigation
            to other modules.
            </p>

            <p>At <i>Elise</i> I was less involved in the viewer module,

            in form of triangle meshes and curves and surface geometries.

            I implemented several optimization algorithms and

            <p>At <i>Contact Software</i> I used C++ to manipulate

            It was a non-trivial piece of code and quite interesting.</p>

            <p>At <i>Elise</i> I used C++ for computationally critical
            algorithms.
            Performance was very important in this code, so we tried to
            optimize things as much as possible.
            We also used modern C++ (C++ 17, template metaprogramming, etc.).

            <p>At <i>Contact Software</i> CAD data was the source

            the first <b>3D visualization</b> project. The requirement was to
            load the CAD data, rearrange and enrich them, and visualize
            them in a web browser.
            So, I did quite a lot things with CAD data, but I never did actually
            use a CAD system to construct something.

            <p>At <i>Elise</i> we build CAD functionality for generative

            It is very easy to write unperformant code with it, though.
            Because of the level of abstraction you don't always know

            It has a lot of Haskell's
